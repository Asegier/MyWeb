            <p>Hello, my name is Christopher J. Chan.  I was born in USA, grew up in Hong

                Kong, and further studied in Canada.

                I'm a diverse individual who's

                passionate about new technology and

                technological advancements, and am

                always using and testing out the latest

                toys and gadgets. I decided to go into

                Web Development as my entry into tech

                from a non-technical background. I

                graduated with a degree in Economics,

                Sociology and Biopsychology, and after

                a couple tries at Private Banking, I

                realized that although lucrative, it didn't

                ignite any passion within me. When I

                found out about the Immersive

                Bootcamp programs, I jumped right into

                it and am excited to finally enter a tech

                related role.

                I also have a wide variety of hobbies,

                from photography to bowling, badminton

                and many more. I enjoy the learning

                process and strive to excel and be

                proficient in every new sport, hobby or

                skill, and have made achievements in many of them, most prominently in

                bowling, where I placed 2nd in U18 Hong

                Kong and have once been featured in the

                local news.

                I'm an energetic person who is easy to

                get along with. I also like UX/UI design

                and have some experience with

                Photoshop as I used to do Photography,

                so I'd be happy to work on UX/UI with a

                designer. I am also an avid researcher

                and knowledge seeker. I love to do my

                research and am proud of my extensive

                knowledge.

                If you hire me, I will bring my technical

                skills, knowledge, and new ideas to your

                company, along with a great team

                working personality and a willingness to

                try and learn anything! </p>
